%LIF Computes the signal transformed by the Linear Integral Filter Method.
%
%    [ulif,ylif]=lif(u,y,Ts,l,n); returns the transformed signals.
%
%    u,y : signals to be transformed.
%    Ts  : sampling period (s) at which i/o data are acquired
%    l   : number of samples for the integration (natural number
%    n   : order of the system
