%HMF Computes the signals transformed by the Hartley Modulating Function, using FFT.
%    FAST version using FFT.
%
%    [yhmf,uhmf]=hmf(y,u,Ts,bw,n) returns the transformed signals yhmf and uhmf.
%
%    y,u : the signals to be transformed in columns.
%    Ts  : sampling period (s) at which i/o data are acquired
%    bw  : bandwidth (rad/s) of the signal to be transformed
%    n   : order of the system
