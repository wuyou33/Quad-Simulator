%   Consider a continuous-time SISO second order system with delay
%   described by the following transfer function:
%
%	                         12
%	 G(s) =   exp(-8s) --------------- 
%	                    s^2 + 4s + 4

    num = 12;
    den = [1 4 4];;
    input_delay = 8;
    M0 = idtf(num,den,'InputDelay',input_delay)

%   The excitation signal is a PRBS sequence.    
    u = prbs(8,20);

%   The input and output are assumed to be uniformly sampled, i.e. the
%   sampling time Ts is constant.
    Ts = 0.1;

%   We then create a DATA object for the input signal with no output, 
%   the input u and sampling interval Ts. Additionally, the input
%   intersample behaviour is specified by setting the property 
%   'Intersample' to 'zoh' since the input is piecewise constant here.    
    datau = iddata([],u,Ts,'InterSample','zoh');

%   The noise-free output is simulated with the SIMC routine and stored in ydet.
%   We then create a data object with output ydet, input u and sampling interval Ts.     
    ydet = simc(M0,datau);
    datadet = iddata(ydet,u,Ts,'Intersample','zoh');
 
%   Let us add noise to the noise-free response considering a 
%   signal-to-noise ratio of 15 dB. Afterwards we plot the data.
    y = simc(M0,datau,15);
    data = iddata(y,u,Ts,'Intersample','zoh');

%   We plot the noise-free data (blue) and the data with noise (red) on a
%   zoomed part of the dataset. The presence of the time-delay is clearly 
%   noticeable since the system answers 8s after the first step at time 40s is sent.

%   We will identify a continuous-time model for this system from the data 
%   object with the TDSRIVC algorithm. The extra information required is
%   the number of numerator (B polynomial) and denominator (F polynomial)
%   parameters, i.e. nn = [nb nf].
    nn = [1 2];
    M = tdsrivc(data,nn)
%   The results are pretty good. Note that the iterative search is initiated 
%   (by default) from the time-delay estimate obtained from delayest (from  
%   the system identification toolbox)

%   Estimation using a priori knowledge: 
%   If there is a guess about the time-delay we can specify it together 
%   with a lower and an upper bound. The true time-delay is Td = 8 and we
%   can call TDSRIVC considering: Td = 5, Tdmin = 0 and Tdmax = 10. 
%   Additionally we can specify lambda0, which is the breakpoint frequency in 
%   "radians/time units" of the state variable filter. lambda0 is chosen so
%   that it is equal to, or larger than, the bandwidth of the system to be
%   identified. However the choice of this parameter is not critical since 
%   convergence occurs over a fairly wide range of values. 
    M = tdsrivc(data,nn,'lambda0',1,'Td',5,'Tdmin',0,'Tdmax',10)

%   Let us compare the output of the estimated model with the
%   noise-free output using the command COMPAREC.

%   Problem using a coarse initial guess:
%   If we use a coarse initial guess for the time-delay, the algorithm is 
%   captured by a local minima, as we can see from the poor fit (large errors
%   on the estimated parameters that can also be observed when comparing 
%   the step responses.

%   Applying the 'Focus' option:
%   To increase the chance of convergence to a global minimum, a low 
%   pass-filtering technique can be applied by using the 'Focus' option. 
%   Then the user must specify the passband of the low pass filter which is
%   defined through the vector [0 fc], where fc is the cut-off frequency of
%   the filter in "radians/time units". A rule of thumb is that fc can be 
%   chosen as (1/10) to (1/2) of the system bandwidth. 
    M2 = tdsrivc(data,nn,'lambda0',1,'Td',2,'Tdmin',0, ...
        'Tdmax',10,'Focus',[0 0.5])
%   The true model is
    present(M0)
%   The fit is clearly much better

    clc
    
%   The better fit can also be observed when comparing the step responses as
%   the new model response cannot be distinguished from the true.
